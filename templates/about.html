      <h3>Are rankings available for classes other than elite?</h3>

      <h3>What happens to ranking points before each calculation?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Points are re-baselined so that the average and standard deviation of Australian points match those of World Ranked Australian athletes over the last 12 months</li>
        <li>This may mean that current ranking points are slightly different from those calculated at the time of the event</li>
        <li>This recalibration maintains alignment with IOF World Ranking scores</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If I enter a junior class, am I eligible for senior ranking points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generally an athlete will score points in the category in which they enter</li>
        <li>The exception is when the junior results are published in the results list of a World Ranking Event. In these cases the athlete shall earn ranking scores in both junior and senior categories</li>
